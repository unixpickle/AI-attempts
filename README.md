# Goal

I am currently interested in the [computational theory of mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_theory_of_mind) and various large projects which aim to reverse-engineer the brain. Ultimately, I'd like to initiate the [technological singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) and cause the extinction of the entire human race.

In all seriousness, though, what am I trying to achieve? I think, for starters, it would be cool to come up with a simple model that would allow a computer to "learn".

# Stepping stones

I think that an addition circuit would be a good first stepping stone. I want some sort of neural network to "learn" to add small numbers together. It will learn this through negative reinforcement. Just as humans learn to change our behavior after experiencing pain, the computer will learn to add numbers after feeling pain from the wrong answer.

Another small stepping stone will be a memory cell--I want a neural network to "remember" a boolean value.

The final stepping stone I want to reach is what I call the "maze". I will place my program in a maze. It will "see" the wall in front of it, or "food" of some kind. It will have the ability to rotate 90 degrees and to move forward. The goal of the program is to navigate the maze and eat food along the way. The program will experience "pain" if it hits a wall, and "hunger" if it does not find food for too long.

# Progress

My first-generation attempt was able to reach my first stepping stone: a small addition neural network.

# But...how?

I don't know yet! I am currently experimenting with different models of neural networks, all of which I plan to invent on my own. This is really just me experimenting.
